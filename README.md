"Electronic University Portal using RFID &amp; Arduino for secure and automated access system."
# 🎓 Electronic Entry Portal (RFID + Arduino)

## 📖 Introduction
May the peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.  
Welcome all to our presentation today.  
This project aims to design and implement an **advanced electronic portal** to control the entry and exit of individuals at the university (students, academic staff, administrators, and workers with registered data in the university system).  

The essence of the project is to provide an **automated entry system based on RFID technology** to facilitate safe and efficient entry/exit processes, eliminating traditional manual checks and reducing unauthorized access.

## 🔌 Protocols
### SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
- Uses 4 main wires for communication:  
  - **MOSI** (Master Out Slave In)  
  - **MISO** (Master In Slave Out)  
  - **SCK** (Clock)  
  - **SS** (Slave Select)  
- Faster than I2C and suitable for high-speed data transfer.
